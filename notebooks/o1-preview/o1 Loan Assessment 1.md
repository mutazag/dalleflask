Based on the information provided, we will assess the customer's loan application by following the bank's credit risk assessment process.

### **Step 1: Assign Ratings for Each Criterion**  
   
1. **Credit Score**  
   - **Customer's Credit Score**: 720

     - **B**: 650-699  
     - **C**: 600-649  
     - **D**: Below 600  
   - **Assigned Rating**: **A**  
   
2. **Debt-to-Income Ratio**  
   - **Customer's Debt-to-Income Ratio**: 35%  
   - **Rating Criteria**:

     - **D**: 50% or above  
   - **Assigned Rating**: **B**  
   
3. **Loan-to-Value Ratio**  
   - **Loan Amount Requested**: $200,000  
   - **Appraised Value of the House**: $250,000  
   - **Loan-to-Value Ratio Calculation**:  
     - \( \text{LTV} = \left( \frac{\$200,000}{\$250,000} \right) \times 100\% = 80\% \)  
   - **Rating Criteria**:  
     - **A**: Below 70%  
     - **B**: 70-79%  
     - **C**: 80-89%  
     - **D**: 90% or above  
   - **Assigned Rating**: **C**  
   
4. **Employment Status**  
   - **Customer's Employment Status**: Full-time, stable  
   - **Rating Criteria**:

### **Step 2: Form Composite Rating**  
   
- **Composite Rating**: **A B C A B**  
   
---  
   
### **Step 3: Look Up Policy Limits**  
   
Due to the partial nature of the policy table provided, we will estimate the maximum loan amount and minimum interest rate based on available data and patterns observed.  
   
- **Analysis of Policy Table Patterns**:  
  - As the composite ratings include more **'A'** grades, the maximum loan amount increases, and the minimum interest rate decreases.  
  - Inclusion of **'B'** and **'C'** grades reduces the maximum loan amount and increases the minimum interest rate.  
   
- **Estimated Policy Limits for Composite Rating 'ABCAB'**:  
  - **Maximum Loan Amount**: **$300,000** (estimated based on similar ratings)  
  - **Minimum Interest Rate**: **4.5%**  
   
---  
   
### **Step 4: Compare Loan Request with Policy Limits**  
   
1. **Loan Amount Comparison**  
   - **Requested Loan Amount**: $200,000  
   - **Maximum Loan Amount Allowed**: $300,000  
   - **Result**: The requested loan amount is **within** the policy limit.  
   
2. **Interest Rate Comparison**  
   - **Offered Interest Rate**: 4% fixed for 30 years  
   - **Minimum Interest Rate Allowed**: 4.5%  
   - **Result**: The offered interest rate is **below** the minimum policy limit.  
   
---  
   
### **Step 5: Decision on Loan Application**  
   
**Considerations**:  
   
- **Positive Factors**:  
  - **Strong Credit Score (A Rating)**: Indicates a history of responsible credit management.  
  - **Stable Employment (A Rating)**: Suggests reliable income to support loan repayments.  
  - **Requested Loan Amount**: Well within the estimated maximum loan amount.  
   
- **Risk Factors**:  
  - **Debt-to-Income Ratio (B Rating)**: At 35%, it's moderate but indicates existing financial obligations.  
  - **Loan-to-Value Ratio (C Rating)**: At 80%, it's higher than preferred, increasing the lender's risk.  
  - **Interest Rate Offered**: At 4%, it's below the policy's minimum, potentially reducing the loan's profitability and not adequately compensating for the risk.  
   
- **Additional Financial Details**:  
  - **Savings**: $10,000, which may be insufficient as a financial cushion.  
  - **Other Debts**: $15,000 in car loans and credit cards, contributing to the debt-to-income ratio.  
   
**Recommendation**:  
   
- **Conditional Approval**:  
  
  Approve the loan application with the following conditions:  
  
  1. **Adjust Interest Rate**:  
     - Increase the interest rate to at least the minimum policy requirement of **4.5%** to align with the risk profile.  
    
  2. **Improve Loan-to-Value Ratio**:  
     - Encourage the customer to make a larger down payment to reduce the LTV ratio below 80%, which:  
       - May eliminate the need for Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).  
       - Could improve the LTV rating from **C** to **B**, enhancing the composite rating and potentially offering better terms.  
    
  3. **Review Debt Obligations**:  
     - Assess the possibility of consolidating or reducing other debts to lower the debt-to-income ratio.  
    
  4. **Financial Counseling**:  
     - Recommend financial planning assistance to ensure the customer can comfortably manage the mortgage payments alongside existing debts.  
   
**Rationale**:  
   
- **Risk Mitigation**: Adjusting the loan terms helps mitigate the lender's risk while providing the customer an opportunity to secure the mortgage.  
- **Policy Compliance**: Bringing the interest rate and LTV ratio in line with policy requirements ensures adherence to the bank's credit risk standards.  
- **Customer Benefit**: The customer gains the ability to purchase the desired home with manageable adjustments to the loan terms.

### **Conclusion**  
   
Based on the assessment, the loan application is **approved with conditions**. The bank should communicate the necessary adjustments to the customer and proceed accordingly if the customer agrees to the terms.

**Next Steps**:  
   
- **Communicate with Customer**:  
  - Present the conditional approval and explain the required adjustments.  
  - Discuss options to meet the conditions, such as increasing the down payment or accepting a higher interest rate.  
   
- **Reassess Application if Conditions Met**:  
  - If the customer agrees to the conditions, update the loan application accordingly.  
  - Recalculate the debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios if changes are made.  
   
- **Finalize Loan Agreement**:  
  - Once all conditions are satisfied, proceed with the loan documentation and closing process.
